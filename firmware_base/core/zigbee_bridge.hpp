// @PROJECT@ - the Zigbee radio of the base board: what the node decides about it, without any hardware.
// Copyright (C) 2026 JuanenRac (Electro Hobby 3D). GPL-3.0-or-later.
//
// The node does not speak Zigbee. A coordinator module (a CC2652P with a Z-Stack coordinator firmware) sits on one of the node's serial lines and the node only lends that line to the
// network, byte for byte, over TCP, to ONE client: Zigbee2MQTT on the server (`serial: port: tcp://<node>:<port>`, adapter `zstack`). What the node decides is in this file:
//   - who may connect: the one IPv4 address named in the settings (the PRIMARY: the server that runs Zigbee2MQTT), and optionally a second one (the FALLBACK: an alarm panel that takes
//     the radio over while the primary has been away for a while), nobody else (a coordinator that anyone could talk to is a house anyone could command);
//   - how the radio is reset, and how it is put into its serial boot loader to be given a new firmware (the order of the two lines and the pauses);
//   - what the panel shows of the bridge.
